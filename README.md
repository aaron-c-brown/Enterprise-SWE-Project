# Enterprise Software Engineering Class Project

### Description:
This is an archive of an Enterprise Software Engineering class project. The project was incrementally developed upon during the course of the 2021 Fall Semester. Wherein we developed a three-tier software system that is essentially all about storing specific types of data about people, e.g. date of birth, names.

### Features:
**Utilizes Springboot and REST APIs to handle web based services**

**Utilized a MariaDB server for storing information about users that login, and the people stored**

**GUI is built with JavaFX**

### How to run:
So long as you use Maven, the program should get and compile its dependencies on its own via the pom.xml file.
After that though, certain functionalities won't work such as the ability to connect to the database as at the time we were provided a database to work with.
